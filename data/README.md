# mintengine - the data folder

there's a lot to uncover, but i'll break it down

- character JSON files go in `data/characters/`
- font TTF and OTF files go in `data/fonts/`
- weeks/level JSON files go in `data/levels/`
- song charts go in `data/songs/`
- stage JSON files [not the lua/hx files] go in `data/stages/`

in the `data/config/` folder you'll find stuff pertaining to other mod metadata, such as modpack settings, achievements, and credits.
