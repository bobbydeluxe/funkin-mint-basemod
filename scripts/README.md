# mintengine - scripts

global scripts can be used the same way as in psych engine

now there are new types of scripts with their placements altered towards the scripts folder

- character scripts: place in `scripts/characters/` instead of `characters/`

- song specific scripts: place in `scripts/songs/yourSongName/` instead of `data/yourSongName/`

- stage scripts: place in `scripts/stages/` instead of `stages/`

- custom event scripts: place in `scripts/events` instead of `custom_events`

- custom event scripts: place in `scripts/notetypes` instead of `custom_notetypes`
